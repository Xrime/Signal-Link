**__Signal Link__**


Signal Link is a 3D puzzle game built with Godot where the player has to go to the enemy terminal to pick their signal and then connect it to their own to peep at their network. The game consists of NPCs (Non-Player Characters) that patrol around the signal point to prevent anyone from picking their signal. The player, including the enemy, is equipped with a flashlight which serves as their line of sight, so the player will always want to avoid light areas to avoid being detected. Also, the moment the player picks up the signal, the NPC will receive an alert and start chasing the player. The player can drop the signal on the floor to avoid being caught and pick it up later. Right now, there is only one map in the game and there are no animations, just a simple nice prototype. An upgrade is coming.
